### Summary
util.js provides a simple framework and interface for storing and running utility scripts. This was built because I often found myself writing scripts to expedite simple, but repetitive tasks at work; each time requiring me to rebuild some kind of simple web structure to hold and run them in. util.js has been designed to be flexible, enabling any kind of Javascript function to be fed inputs and executed with a button.

### User Interface
The util.js UI consists of 7 main components: 

1. **File Input:** users can upload a file of any kind by pressing here.
2. **Text Input:** users can enter text input here.
3. **Utility Panel:** a button is rendered here for each utility script.
4. **Download Result:** clicking this button will download the results of the last executed utility script as a .txt file. 
5. **Result Panel:** the result of the utility script is dumped here as Unicode text.
6. **Console Panel:** utilities can print errors and messages here.
7. **User Input:** the console can receive user input here when activated.
